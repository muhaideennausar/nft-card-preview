## My Approach

In this challenge, I focused on creating a pixel-perfect NFT preview card for desktop devices. Here are some key aspects of my approach:

* **HTML Structure**: I carefully structured the HTML to represent the content of the NFT card, including the image, title, artist name.

* **CSS Styling**: I used CSS to style the card, ensuring that it matched the provided design as closely as possible. This included setting fonts, colors, spacing, and positioning elements.

* **Responsive Design**: Although I did for the desktop version only, I made sure that my solution was well-structured and could be easily adapted for responsiveness in the future.

* **Responsive Design**: Extend the solution to be responsive for various screen sizes, including tablets and mobile devices.

* **Interactive Features**: Add interactive elements such as hover effects, tooltips, or links to enhance the user experience.

* **Accessibility**: Ensure that the NFT card meets accessibility standards for a wider audience.

* **Dynamic Content**: Connect the card to real data sources or APIs to display dynamic NFT information.
